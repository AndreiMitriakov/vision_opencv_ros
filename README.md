# vision_opencv_ros
A project made in ENSTA during summer internship for ERL competitions, concerning computer vision.
You can find inside realisation of table detection, color determination of colorised tables, an algorithm finding distance tables and providing their coordinates.
Moreover, this code can find red valves and define distance to them.
Also, the support vector machine (SVM) with HOG descriptors is implemented to recognise digits on yellow tables.

Used technologies: C++, OpenCV
